commands :

1) kubectl create deployment myproject --image=docker.io/kumarbavandla/go-web-hello-world:v0.1

result:
-------
$kubectl get services
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   87m

$ kubectl get deployments
NAME        READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
myproject   1/1     1            1           28m
kumar@k8node:~$

2) exposing the port 
$ kubectl expose deployment/myproject --type="NodePort" --port 8081
service/myproject exposed

Note: it exposed to a random port(32273) which is expected as I read from the internet. To expose a specific port, looks a service 
definition file has to be prepared accordingly and apply (kubectl apply -f ..)

However, I have updated the port forwarding in virtual box for this random port (32273) and I could see the message from the service.

3) NOT DONE fully - dashboard deployment
Its still ongoing.

- I found some documentation as how to setup the access control for the dashboard : https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/docs/user/access-control/README.md
- However since the dashboard is installed inside the vm, some thing more should be fixed in order to access from the host.
